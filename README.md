# Algorithmic-Methods
Repository of the Algorithmic Methods Course - Data Science @ Unipd. 

Here you'll find the notes with the theory and almost all exercises (exception of the graph ones). 
It contains the main elements faced during the course, with the exception of Uncertain Graphs and Text Justification. 

A new version will be made soon.
